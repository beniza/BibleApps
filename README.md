This repository contains various apps or scripts to manipulate Bible text in different format
Most of the files you find on this repository are created for my personal use and sharing here with the expectation that it will be of use to somebody else.
I'm new to Python programming so you may find a lot of gaps/incompleteness in the code I write. Thanks to the courses offered by Edx, coursera and codeacacemy, I hope I'll learn soon how to do good programming in Python. I can't take any responsibility or I don't claim that the scripts will do what I expect them to do in all situations. If you are using these in one of your projects, please do modify it to fit to your needs.
